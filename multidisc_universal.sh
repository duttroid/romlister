#todo: prompt user for rompath and use rompath as the path argument for `find` (probably guide user to enter full path for flexibility, or use . for current directory)
#todo: move each file to subfolder multidisc_games after appending m3u files
#todo: backup Emulationstation gamelists and Attract Mode romlists - add date to each folder
#todo: generate gamelists for Emulationstation and Attract Mode.  Copy each to /home/pi/gamelists-romlists as well as the default directory for Emulationstation gamelists and Attract Mode romlists
#todo: figure out file extension flexibility
#todo: figure out how to cut to last field of /PATH/TO/FILE

#todo: edit the rompath such that /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ is built into the variable (user specifies only the last branch of the directory tree)
#todo: backup gamelists when this script is run (date+gamelists+backup or date+romlists directory+backup alongside the original in the same hierarchy level.
#todo: generate gamelists after multidisc roms/images are moved to multidisc_games
#todo: move roms/images from multidisc_games directory to original rom directory when gamelist is complete
#todo: remove empty multidisc_games directory after roms are returned to their original directory
#todo: test this script with rom directories that have subfolders (should be fine. verify)
#todo: set this script as a command in raspbian
#todo: add command line option to skip gamelist generation
#todo: directory selector / gui?
#todo: put this on github, yo!
