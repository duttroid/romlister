#todo: backup gamelists when this script is run (date+gamelists+backup or date+romlists directory+backup alongside the original in the same hierarchy level).
#todo: generate gamelists after multidisc roms/images are moved to multidisc_games
#todo: move roms/images from multidisc_games directory to original rom directory when gamelist is complete
#todo: remove empty multidisc_games directory after roms are returned to their original directory
#todo: test this script with rom directories that have subfolders (should be fine. verify)
#todo: set this script as a command in raspbian
#todo: add command line option to skip gamelist generation
#todo: directory selector / gui?
